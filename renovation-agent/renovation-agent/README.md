Agents with ADK: From Prototype to Project
This repository houses the code and resources for a Google Codelabs tutorial, guiding you through the process of building and deploying AI agents using the Agent Development Kit (ADK). Learn how to transform your AI prototypes into robust, collaborative multi-agent systems.

# Overview
The tutorial begins by showcasing Google AI Studio as your prototyping sandbox. Here, you'll leverage powerful Gemini models to craft detailed prompts and generate contentâ€”for instance, a comprehensive kitchen renovation plan.

The core focus then shifts to the Agent Development Kit (ADK). ADK provides a flexible and powerful framework for building sophisticated multi-agent systems where different agents can collaborate or coordinate to achieve a larger objective. This approach offers significant advantages, including enhanced modularity and reusability in your AI solutions.

What You'll Learn
# Prototyping with Google AI Studio: Generate detailed prompts and content using Gemini models.

#Transitioning to ADK: Move from a simple prototype prompt to a functional agent system.

#Setting Up Your Environment: Practical steps for configuring a Google Cloud project and environment for ADK development.

# ADK Project Structure: Understand how to structure your ADK projects effectively.

#Building a Single Agent: Create an agent capable of generating and storing renovation proposal documents in Google Cloud Storage.

#Running and Testing Agents: Learn how to execute and verify the functionality of your ADK agents.
